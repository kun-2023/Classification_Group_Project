<h1 style="text-align:center">Classification Group Project</h1>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p>In this project, my team and I will explore the telecom data to find out the factors leading to a customer's unsubscription to the service, and what the company can do to change that. </p>
<p> We also created multiple machine learning models to help companies to identify customers likely to churn or unsubscribe to your service before they do, so you and your company doesn't have to worry about losing customers ever again. Well at least not as much as before. Tune in for more.</p>
